# Portfolio site, built with Node.js and Express
A simple portfolio bundling the projects I have worked on so far

## General Info

The aim for this showcase website is to let potential clients and employers see what I have done so far and the stack I have 
been using on each of the projects. Expect this app to grow as my journey towards a Full-Stack developer continues.

I altered the CSS margins a bit to give it a more polished look. Some hover functions on the image thumbnails and links. I redid the 
background colors and added a bit of margin here and there to give it a less cramped feeling. 

## Technologies

* HTML 5   
* CSS 3
* JavaScript ES6
* Node.js
* Express


The app is started by downloading all the files and by running the `npm install` and then `npm start`. Any modern browser should support the code used for this project.

### Note:

Future update may include more projects and CSS styling.
